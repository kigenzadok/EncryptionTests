# EncryptionTests
Testing the strength and performance of encryption code in Python
How the Script Works

    Test Correctness:
        Verifies that encrypted data can be decrypted back to the original plaintext.

    Test Performance:
        Measures encryption and decryption times for a large input.

    Test Randomness:
        Analyzes the entropy of the ciphertext to ensure strong randomness.

    Test Integrity:
        Tests the ability to detect tampering using AES-GCM (authenticated encryption).
